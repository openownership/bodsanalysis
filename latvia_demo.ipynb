Opening Extractives aims to transform the availability and use of beneficial ownership data for effective governance in the extractive sector.\n",

    "**Query interpretation:** Providing details about ownership or control interests is not a required element, according to the [BODS v0.2 schema](https://standard.openownership.org/en/0.2.0/schema/index.html). However, we would expect Interest details to be recorded for a majority of ownership or control statements. A range (i.e. at least two) of interest types should be recorded across ownership or control statements. Beneficial owners in particular are expected to encompass [a range of interest types](https://standard.openownership.org/en/0.2.0/schema/reference.html?highlight=interest#interesttype), so we expect to see a range of values in the data where [beneficial ownership or control is True](https://standard.openownership.org/en/0.3.0/schema/guidance/repr-beneficial-ownership.html). In most jurisdictions, the majority of interest types are expected to be ‘shareholding’ or ‘voting’ rights, and only a minority of cases should be ‘other influence or control’.\n",
